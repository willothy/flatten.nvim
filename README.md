# flatten.nvim

Flatten allows you to open files from a neovim terminal buffer in your current neovim instance instead of a nested one in the terminal.

The name is inspired by the flatten function in Rust (and maybe other languages?), which flattens nested types (`Option<Option<T>>` -> `Option<T>`, etc).

The plugin itself is inspired by [`nvim-unception`](https://github.com/samjwill/nvim-unception), which accomplishes the same goal but functions a bit differently and doesn't allow as much configuration. Flatten uses modules and doesn't add any globals, which I think makes the codebase more convenient to work with and by extension less bug-prone.

## Features

- [X] Open files from terminal buffers without creating a nested session
- [X] Allow blocking for git commits
- [X] Configuration
    - [X] Callbacks for user-specific workflows
    - [X] Open in vsplit, split, tab, or current window
- [X] Setting to [force blocking](#usage) from the commandline, regardless of filetype
- [ ] Pipe from terminal into a new Neovim buffer (coming soon)

Config for demo [here](#advanced-configuration) (autodelete gitcommit on write and toggling terminal are not defaults)

## Installation[^1]

With `lazy.nvim`:

```lua

{
    'willothy/flatten.nvim',
    config = true
    -- or pass configuration with
    -- opts = {  }
    -- Ensure that it runs first to minimize delay when opening file from terminal
    lazy = false, priority = 1001,
}

```

[^1]: Lazy loading this plugin is not recommended - flatten should always be loaded as early as possible. Starting the host is essentially overhead-free other than the setup() function as it leverages the RPC server started on init by Neovim, and loading plugins before this in a guest session will only result in poor performance. 

To avoid loading plugins in guest sessions you can use the following in your config:
```lua
-- If opening from inside neovim terminal then do not load all the other plugins
if os.getenv("NVIM") ~= nil then
    require('lazy').setup {
        {'willothy/flatten.nvim', config = true },
    }
    return
end

-- Otherwise proceed as normal
require('lazy').setup( --[[ your normal config ]] )
```

## Usage

```sh
# force blocking from the commandline
nvim --cmd 'let g:flatten_wait=1' file1

# set VISUAL to block, for use with edit-exec
VISUAL="nvim --cmd 'let g:flatten_wait=1'"

# otherwise, just open files as normal,
# and they'll open in your current instance.
nvim file1 file2

```

## Configuration

### Defaults

Flatten comes with the following defaults:

```lua
{
    callbacks = {
        -- Called when a request to edit file(s) is received
        pre_open = function() end,
        -- Called after a file is opened
        -- Passed the buf id, win id, and filetype of the new window
        post_open = function(bufnr, winnr, filetype, is_blocking) end,
        -- Called when a file is open in blocking mode, after it's done blocking
        -- (after bufdelete, bufunload, or quitpre for the blocking buffer)
        block_end = function() end,
    },
    -- <String, Bool> dictionary of filetypes that should be blocking
    block_for = {
        gitcommit = true
    },
    -- Window options
    window = {
        -- Options:
        -- current        -> open in current window (default)
        -- tab            -> open in new tab
        -- split          -> open in split
        -- vsplit         -> open in vsplit
        -- func(new_bufs) -> only open the files, allowing you to handle window opening yourself. 
        -- Argument is an array of buffer numbers representing the newly opened files.
        open = "current",
        -- Affects which file gets focused when opening multiple at once
        -- Options:
        -- "first"        -> open first file of new files (default)
        -- "last"         -> open last file of new files
        focus = "first"
    }
}
```

### Advanced configuration

Similarly to `nvim-unception`, if you use a toggleable terminal and don't want the opened file(s) to be opened in the same window as your terminal buffer, you may want to use the `pre_open` callback to close the terminal. You can even reopen it immediately after the file is opened using the `post_open` callback for a truly seamless experience. 

Note that when opening a file in blocking mode, such as a git commit, the terminal will be inaccessible. You can get the filetype from the bufnr or filetype arguments of the `post_open` callback to only reopen the terminal for non-blocking files.

Here's my setup for toggleterm, including an autocmd to automatically close a git commit buffer on write:

```lua
{
    'willothy/flatten.nvim',
    opts = {
        callbacks = {
            pre_open = function()
                -- Close toggleterm when an external open request is received
                require("toggleterm").toggle(0)
            end,
            post_open = function(bufnr, winnr, ft, is_blocking)
                if ft == "gitcommit" then
                    -- If the file is a git commit, create one-shot autocmd to delete it on write
                    -- If you just want the toggleable terminal integration, ignore this bit and only use the
                    -- code in the else block
                    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(
                        "BufWritePost",
                        {
                            buffer = bufnr,
                            once = true,
                            callback = function()
                                -- This is a bit of a hack, but if you run bufdelete immediately 
                                -- the shell can occasionally freeze
                                vim.defer_fn(
                                    function()
                                        vim.api.nvim_buf_delete(bufnr, {})
                                    end,
                                    50
                                )
                            end
                        }
                    )
                elseif not is_blocking
                    -- If it's a normal file, then reopen the terminal, then switch back to the newly opened window
                    -- This gives the appearance of the window opening independently of the terminal
                    require("toggleterm").toggle(0)
                    vim.api.nvim_set_current_win(winnr)
                end
            end,
            block_end = function()
                -- After blocking ends (for a git commit, etc), reopen the terminal
                require("toggleterm").toggle(0)
            end
        }
    }
}

```
